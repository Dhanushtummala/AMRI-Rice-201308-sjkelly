## Point analysis
### Goal
Simulation based experiment to quantitatively measure droplet position and shape accuracy.
### Quantify
* Circularity
* Ellipsoid function (momentum)
* Thresholding
* Positioning (gantry positioning and nozzle inaccuracies)
### Experiment
We will generate sample output using an image editor. The samples will be of ideal and poor output. OpenCV or ImageJ will be used to quantify these images computationally.
